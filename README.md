## Project-02:  Hangman game! 

**Description:**
 This game allows a player to guess letters to reveal a hidden word while having a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives). The game provides feedback on each guess, tracks progress, and displays the hangman stages as lives decrease.
 
 You can play a sample version of the game here:https://hangmanwordgame.com/?fca=1&success=0#/

**Approach:**

**Step-1: **Initialize the Game: Create a list of possible words.

**Step-2: **Select a Random Word: Randomly choose a target word from the list.

**Step-3: **Display Current State: Show the current state of the word and remaining attempts.

**Step-4: **User Input: Prompt for a letter guess and validate it.

**Step-5: **Check Win/Loss Conditions: Declare the user as the winner if they guess the word; declare them as the loser if they exceed incorrect guesses.

**Step-6: **Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play again; restart or exit based on their response.
